**Instructions:**

1. **Bake Cake Layers:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Coat two 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray. Line the bottoms of each pan with wax paper.
2. **Cocoa Mixture:** Combine cocoa powder, boiling water, and melted butter in a bowl; whisk until blended. Cool.
3. **Cake Batter:** In a large bowl, combine sugars; stir well until blended. Add egg substitute and beat for 2 minutes or until light and creamy. Add cocoa mixture; beat for 1 minute.
4. **Dry Ingredients:** Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl.
5. **Combine:** Gradually add flour mixture to the sugar mixture; beat for 1 minute or until blended. Stir in vanilla extract.
6. **Bake:** Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake for 28 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Remove from pans.
7. **Freeze Cake Layers:** Wrap cake layers in plastic wrap and freeze for 2 hours or until slightly frozen.
8. **Prepare Ice Cream Layer:** Spread softened ice cream in an 8-inch round cake pan lined with plastic wrap. Cover and freeze for 4 hours or until firm.
9. **Assemble Cake:** Place one cake layer, bottom side up, on a cake pedestal. Remove ice cream layer from freezer; remove plastic wrap. Place ice cream layer, bottom side up, on top of cake layer. Top with remaining cake layer.
10. **Frost & Finish:** Combine whipped topping and peppermint extract; stir until blended. Spread frosting over top and sides of cake. Sprinkle with crushed peppermints.
11. **Freeze & Serve:** Freeze until ready to serve. Let cake stand at room temperature for 10 minutes before slicing.
