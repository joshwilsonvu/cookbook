1. Drain the coconut water by puncturing the three eyes of the coconut and pouring the water into a bowl. (You can use a _clean_ screwdriver and tap it through with a hammer.) Reserve.
2. Score the coconut along its equator and split the shell in half by tapping along the line with a hammer. Continue breaking it into smaller pieces.
3. Remove the flesh of the coconut from the shell pieces with a spoon or table knife.
4. Add the coconut flesh and coconut water to a blender, and add hot water to reach 6 cups of volume total. Blend until smooth.
5. Strain the coconut milk through cheesecloth into a large bowl to remove solids. Squeeze the cheesecloth to extract as much liquid as possible.
