1. Heat oil in a medium heavy pan over medium heat. Cook marinated pork (if using) until golden brown.
2. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Add green pepper, mashed garlic, cilantro, and fresh tomato.
4. Add the can of gandules (including liquid), water, tomato sauce, alcaparado, and pimientos morrones. There should be 4 cups of liquid total, including gandules juice and tomato sauce. Add salt to taste.
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the liquid is absorbed (about 15–20 minutes).
6. Reduce heat further to keep the rice burning. Once water is absorbed, turn gently from bottom to top once or twice.
7. Cover and cook on low heat until rice is tender, about 25 minutes total. Turn the rice one more time and serve.
