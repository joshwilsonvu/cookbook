1. The night before, mix the chicken and marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Cover and let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
2. Chop the yellow onions and green bell pepper together roughly (1/2 inch pieces), with a food processor if available. Set aside.
3. Finely chop the ginger, garlic, and hot pepper (1/4 inch pieces) in a food processor. Add to the chopped onions and bell pepper.
4. Heat about 3 tbsp of oil in a thick, wide saucepan or dutch oven on medium heat. Add chopped vegetables and cook until soft.
5. Add spices: turmeric, curry powder, oregano, cloves, paprika, bay leaves, cardamom, and black pepper. (If using cardamom pods, crack them open and add only the seeds inside.) Cook spices for 2-3 minutes.
6. Add the can of chopped tomatoes and cook for about 3 minutes.
7. Add marinated chicken and cook for 12-13 minutes, adding water only if necessary. Turn the chicken over every few minutes until nice and soft. Salt to taste.
8. If using, add the potato wedges to the curry and cook for about 10 minutes, until soft. Add water as necessary to maintain the curry's consistency.
9. Reduce heat and let the curry sit and breathe for at least 5 minutes. Add garam masala and chopped cilantro on top. Serve with rice and naan and enjoy!
