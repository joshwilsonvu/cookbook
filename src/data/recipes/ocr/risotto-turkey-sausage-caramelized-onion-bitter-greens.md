1. Bring broth and clam juice to a simmer in a medium saucepan (do not boil). Keep warm over low heat.
2. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sugar; sauté 7–10 minutes or until golden and set aside.
3. Add sausage to pan; sauté 4 minutes or until browned, crumbling as you go. Add shallots; sauté 2 minutes. Add rice and sauté for 30 seconds.
4. Stir in white wine; cook 45 seconds or until nearly absorbed, stirring constantly. Stir in 1 cup hot broth; cook 2 minutes or until nearly absorbed, stirring constantly. 
5. Add remaining broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until each portion is absorbed before adding the next (about 20 minutes total).
6. Remove from heat; stir in reserved onion, arugula, cheese, and lemon rind.
