1. Heat oil over medium heat.
2. While the oil is heating up, peel the green plantains and cut into 3/4-inch slices, diagonally.
3. Fry slices in hot oil until soft and light golden. Drain on paper towels.
4. When cool enough to handle, press plantain slices flat and round. A tostonera (plantain press) works best of course, but a flat-bottomed plate or sturdy spatula will work.
5. Fry at a higher temperature until crispy and golden brown. Remove them and drain on a large plate covered in paper towels.
6. Serve tostones with mayo, ketchup, and garlic mixed in a small bowl, or just ketchup.
