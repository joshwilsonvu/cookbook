1. Marinate chicken with garlic salt and yogurt.
2. Brown chicken in olive oil in a heavy pan over medium heat for 5 minutes per side.
3. Remove chicken and set aside. Leave drippings in the pan.
4. Add onions and bell pepper to the pan until softened.
5. Add mashed garlic, cilantro, olives, capers, and paprika.
6. Return chicken to the pan. Add rice, tomato (or diced tomatoes/puree), and water (enough to reach 4 cups).
7. Add salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until water is absorbed (about 15–20 minutes).
8. Reduce heat further, turn the rice from bottom to top, and continue to cook until done, about 25 minutes total. Turn the rice one more time and serve.
