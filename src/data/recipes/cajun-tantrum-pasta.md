1. In a pot, cook noodles to al-dente, strain and set aside, leaving ½ cup of pasta water.
2. Put a stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat with vegetable oil. Add andouille sausage and onions.
3. After 2 minutes, add minced garlic and spinach. Cook until spinach is cooked down near a paste. Remove from pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add jalapeños and oil. Cook until fragrant. Add ½ cup of white wine to deglaze pan. Add butter and flour until a paste is formed, slowly streaming in cream until incorporated. Add most of cheese until a sauce is formed.
5. Add sausage-spinach mixture back into the pan, along with ½ cup of pasta water. Once incorporated, add pasta and stir. Pour into a well-greased 9x9 pyrex.
6. In a small skillet, add crushed red pepper and breadcrumbs and lightly toast. Top pasta with breadcrumb mix and leftover cheese. Place in oven at 350° for 10 minutes.
7. In a blender, add sour cream/creama, diced jalapeños, chipotle pepper, and the juice of two limes. Blend until smooth. Top pasta with the sauce and chopped green onions.
