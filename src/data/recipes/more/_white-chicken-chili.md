Add the following ingredients to the instant pot:
2 cans garbanzo beans
1 can black beans
1 can red or pinto beans
1 can diced tomatoes
1 small can diced green chiles (optional)
1 32 oz carton of chicken broth (I use lower sodium broth)
2 packets taco seasoning (I use Old El Paso lower sodium mix)
Chicken breast (I usually use about two pounds but you can adjust if you want it less dense with chicken)

At the top of the ingredients, add 1 block (8 oz) cream cheese, cut into 6-8 pieces (lower fat cream cheese works well too).

Seal the instant pot and pressure cook on high for 30 minutes (I usually use the chili setting for 30 minutes).

Let the instant pot release pressure naturally. Shred the chicken. Use a masher to break up the pieces of cream cheese and mix it up. If the chili is too thick for your liking, add in additional chicken broth as needed.

Serve with Mexican cheese, green onions and cilantro. We also like it with a side of cornbread for a nice, comforting meal.
